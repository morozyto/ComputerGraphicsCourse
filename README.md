A Computer Graphics course in BMSTU using OpenGL.

lab3 - Drawing a cube and a cone in the orthogonal projection. The cone can be moved along the axes, rotated around each of the axes, resized. A cone can dynamically change the quality of a partition. You can remove the primitive shading and get the skeleton of the shapes.

lab4 - Painting an arbitrary polygon using an eight-connected fill algorithm and the modified Brezenham's line algorithm. It is possible to apply 3x3 weighted post-filtration.

lab5 - Clipping of one figure by another using a modified Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm.

lab6 - Remake of lab3 with lighting, animation, texturing and with the opportunity to save state.

lab7 - Remake of lab6 using optimizations, which you can enable/disable in configuration file.

lab8 - Remake of lab3 using GLSL.
